    To test this file:
    $ rst2man < doc/python-coverage.1.txt  | groff -man -Tascii


SYNOPSIS
========

| |command| `command` [ `option` ... ]
| |command| **help** [ `command` ]


DESCRIPTION
===========

|command| executes a Python program and measures which of its statements are
executed and which are not, and reports these coverage measurements.


COMMAND OVERVIEW
================

|command| **annotate**
    Annotate source files with execution information.

|command| **combine**
    Combine a number of data files.

|command| **erase**
    Erase previously collected coverage data.

|command| **help**
    Get help on using coverage.py.

|command| **html**
    Create an HTML report.

|command| **report**
    Report coverage stats on modules.

|command| **run**
    Run a Python program and measure code execution.

|command| **xml**
    Create an XML report of coverage results.


GLOBAL OPTIONS
==============

**--help**, **-h**
    Describe how to use Coverage, in general or a command.

**--rcfile** `RCFILE`
    Specify configuration file `RCFILE`. Defaults to ``.coveragerc``.

**--omit** `PATTERN` [ , ... ]
    Omit files when their filename matches one of these PATTERNs.
    Usually needs quoting on the command line.

**--include** `PATTERN` [ , ... ]
    Include only files whose paths match one of these
    PATTERNs. Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be quoted.


COMMAND REFERENCE
=================

**annotate**

    Options:

    \-d `DIR`, --directory=`DIR`
        Write the output files to DIR.

    \-i, --ignore-errors
        Ignore errors while reading source files.

**combine**

    Combine data from multiple coverage files collected with ``run -p``.
    The combined results are written to a single file representing the
    union of the data.

**erase**

    Erase previously collected coverage data.

**help** [ `command` ]

    Describe how to use Coverage.

**help** **classic**

    Describe help on older command syntax.

**html** [ `option` ... ] [ `MODULE` ... ]

    Create an HTML report of the coverage of each `MODULE` file. Each file
    gets its own page, with the source decorated to show executed,
    excluded, and missed lines.

    Options:

    \-d `DIR`, --directory `DIR`
        Write the output files to `DIR`.

    \--fail-under `MIN`
        Exit with a status of 2 if the total coverage is less than `MIN`.

    \-i, --ignore-errors
        Ignore errors while reading source files.

    \--title `TITLE`
        Use the text string `TITLE` as the title on the HTML.

**report** [ `option` ... ] [ `MODULE` ... ]

    Report coverage statistics on each `MODULE`.

    Options:

    \--fail-under `MIN`
        Exit with a status of 2 if the total coverage is less than `MIN`.

    \-i, --ignore-errors
        Ignore errors while reading source files.

    \-m, --show-missing
        Show line numbers of statements in each module that weren't
        executed.

**run** [ `options` ... ] `PROGRAMFILE` [ `program_options` ]

    Run a Python program `PROGRAMFILE`, measuring code execution.

    Options:

    \-a, --append
        Append coverage data to .coverage, otherwise it is started clean
        with each run.

    \--branch
        Measure branch coverage in addition to statement coverage.

    \--concurrency `LIB`
        Properly measure code using a concurrency library. Valid values are:
        thread, gevent, greenlet, eventlet.

    \--debug `DEBUGOPT`,...
        Debug options `DEBUGOPT`, separated by commas.

    \-L, --pylib
        Measure coverage even inside the Python installed library, which
        isn't done by default.

    \-p, --parallel-mode
        Append the machine name, process id and random number to the
        ``.coverage`` data file name to simplify collecting data from many
        processes.

    \--source `SOURCE` ...
        A list of packages or directories of code to be measured.

    \--timid
        Use a simpler but slower trace method. Try this if you get
        seemingly impossible results!

**xml** [ `options` ... ] [ `MODULES` ... ]

    Generate an XML report of coverage results on each `MODULE`.

    Options:

    \--fail-under `MIN`
        Exit with a status of 2 if the total coverage is less than `MIN`.

    \-i, --ignore-errors
        Ignore errors while reading source files.

    \-o `OUTFILE`
        Write the XML report to `OUTFILE`. Defaults to ``coverage.xml``.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
=====================

COVERAGE_FILE

    Path to the file where coverage measurements are collected to and
    reported from. Default: ``.coverage`` in the current working directory.


HISTORY
=======

The |command| command is a Python program which calls the ``coverage``
Python library to do all the work.

The library was originally developed by Gareth Rees, and is now developed
by Ned Batchelder.
